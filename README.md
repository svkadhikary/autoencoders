Implementation of Autoencoders with Tensorflow and Pytorch
This repository contains an implementation of a simple autoencoder using PyTorch and Tensorflow. The code is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and demonstrates the steps involved in building and training an autoencoder model on the MNIST dataset.

## Contents

- `AutoEncoders_Pytorch.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing the Pytorch code for the autoencoder implementation.
- `AutoEncoders_Tensorflow.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing the Tensorflow code for the autoencoder implementation.
- `data`: Folder containing the MNIST dataset (downloaded automatically if not present).
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the repository.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/your-username/autoencoder.git```

2. Open the `AutoEncoders_Pytorch.ipynb` or `AutoEncoders_Tensorflow.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

3. Run the notebook cells step-by-step to fetch the data, preprocess it, create the autoencoder model, train the model, and perform inference.

## Requirements

The following dependencies are required to run the code:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- numpy
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

pip install torch torchvision jupyter notebook
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib


Note: Make sure you have a compatible GPU and the required drivers installed if you want to leverage GPU acceleration with TensorFlow or Pytorch.

Feel free to use the code provided in this repository as a starting point for your own autoencoder projects. If you find this repository helpful, consider giving it a star!

## Acknowledgments

- The code in this repository is inspired by various autoencoder implementations and tutorials available in the TensorFlow and Keras and Pytorch communities.
